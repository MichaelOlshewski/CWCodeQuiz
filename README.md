# __*JavaScript Code Quiz*__

## __Details About This Assignment__
This homework was about putting together everything that we learned the past 5+ weeks, HTML, CSS and JavaScript into one application. I had to develop the HTML Structure, CSS Styling and JavaScript Logic by hand. The criteria seemed simple but this was definitely a difficult task. There are currently 3 questions added, and more can be added through the questions array. Timer length can be changed with a single line in the JavaScript code. Each answer that is wrong, must deduct 10 seconds, if that time goes below 0, it takes you to the score screen where you can save your score and name to local storage. The whole application was made with a single index.html page, and using DOM Manipulation to edit the page accordingly to what is being press on screen.
